              One of the key titles of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was to
              eliminate discriminatory voter registration practices that had
              previously made it difficult or even impossible for many African
              Americans to vote. In this page, we explore how the Civil Rights
              Act addressed this issue and why it was a significant frontier for
              African Americans.

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      African Americans faced many obstacles to voting before
                      the Civil Rights Act was passed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Some states in the South had implemented discriminatory
                      voter registration practices including&nbsp;literacy tests
                      and poll taxes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Due to these practices, many African Americans found it
                      difficult to register to vote.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Even if they managed to register, they often faced
                      intimidation and violence at the polls.

                      The American Journal of Sociology once stated "Direct
                      action in the rural South was a prescription for death.
                      Even registering to vote was
                      life-threatening"&nbsp;(Robnett)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This highlights the harsh reality of racial oppression and
                      violence that African Americans faced in the South before
                      the passage of the Civil Rights Act.

                    <li>
                      The quote suggests that any form of protest or political
                      participation by African Americans in the deep south was
                      met with hostility and danger.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The danger came from white supremacists who wanted to
                      maintain segregation and inequality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The act of registering to vote was a life-threatening for
                      African Americans in the rural South.

                      The likelihood of black voters participating in
                      presidential elections compared to their white
                      counterparts grew 6% from 1968 to 1964 (United States
                      Census Bureau), according to the United States Census
                      Bureau .
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This indicates that after the passage of the Civil Rights
                      Act in 1964, African Americans were more likely to
                      participate in presidential elections compared to their
                      white counterparts and how quickly African Americans ages
                      25-44 were to start voting compared to other age groups.

                    <li>
                      The increase in black voter participation can be
                      attributed to the equalization of protections and rights
                      granted to them by the Civil Rights Act.

                      Sam Mahone was a member of the Student Nonviolent
                      Coordinating Committee during segregation and participated
                      in various forms of activism.

                    <li>
                      His activism included picketing a segregated movie theater
                      and going door to door registering Black voters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Mahone explains that a “fellow just released them,
                      unconditionally, dropped the charges and what have you,
                      and declared that segregated voter lines were no longer
                      being tolerated in Sumter County" (Library of Congress).

                    <li>
                      By passing the Civil Rights Act, the federal government
                      made it clear that discriminatory voter registration
                      practices were no longer acceptable and&nbsp;prohibited
                      the use of literacy tests, poll taxes, and other
                      discriminatory measures that had been used to prevent
                      African Americans from voting.

                    <li>
                      The fact that someone was able to "release them,
                      unconditionally, dropped the charges and what have you"
                      suggests that the Civil Rights Act was being enforced and
                      that African Americans were starting to see some real
                      changes in their ability to exercise their right to vote.

          <h2 class="text-info">Why was this a frontier?</h2>
          <p style="max-width: 800px">
            The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a major step forward in the fight
            for voting rights for African Americans. It prohibited
            discriminatory voter registration practices and allowed for federal
            oversight of elections in areas with a history of discrimination.
            This helped to ensure that African Americans could exercise their
            right to vote without fear of intimidation or violence.<br /><br />The
            barring of unequal application of voter registration requirements
            was a significant frontier for African Americans, as it helped to
            address one of the most fundamental issues facing the Civil Rights
            Movement. By eliminating discriminatory practices that had prevented
            many African Americans from voting, the Civil Rights Act helped to
            create a more equitable and just society.
