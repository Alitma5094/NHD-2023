            <p style="max-width: 640px">
              During the Civil Rights Movement, African Americans faced
              discrimination and segregation in public spaces such as
              restaurants, schools, and public transportation. They were often
              denied access to these spaces based on the color of their skin,
              leading to a lack of basic rights and freedoms.

                      Peter Irons wrote a book called "Jim Crow's Schools" in
                      which he&nbsp;describes the abysmally low educational
                      status of Blacks in the Jim Crow states in
                      1950&nbsp;(Irons)

                      Black schools were underfunded, understaffed, and provided
                      an inferior education compared to white schools
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Black adults had completed an average of only 4.8 to 5.1
                      years of schooling,&nbsp;compared to four of 10 whites who
                      had earned their high school diploma

                      Leading Black educators at the time attributed the
                      inferior black schools to racial segregation.

                      In an article by Gerald Rosenberg, he explains “Although
                      the majestic guarantee of equal protection was enshrined
                      in the Civil Rights Act, it took nearly another century
                      before all three branches of government were willing to
                      act in a meaningful way to enforce it” (Unbound and
                      Rosenberg).

                      This suggests that the fight against discrimination was a
                      long and difficult one, spanning several generations.

            This was a significant breakthrough for African Americans who had
            been fighting for equal rights and access to public accommodations
            for decades. The Act allowed them to freely access public spaces,
            and it was a major step towards creating a more equitable society.
