              In addition to barring discriminatory voter registration
              practices, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 also aimed to eliminate
              discrimination in the workplace. This section will explore how the
              Civil Rights Act created more opportunities for employment for
              African Americans.

                      African Americans were denied equal employment

                      A study from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
                      shows that African American participation in skilled
                      professions increased significantly after the Civil Rights

                    <li>
                      In 1966, African American professionals reported a
                      participation rate of 1.32 percent and the participation
                      rate increased to 7.75 percent by 2008&nbsp;(United States

                      The Act opened up more opportunities for African Americans

                      dominated by white workers.

            By prohibiting employment discrimination based on race, color,
            religion, sex, or national origin, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was
            a frontier for African Americans in creating more opportunities for
            employment. It opened new doors for African Americans to access
            skilled jobs that were previously closed off to them, allowing them
            to attain higher paying, more stable jobs and increase their social
            and economic mobility.
